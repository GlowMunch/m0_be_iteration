# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I feel good about it. I just need a better grasp on using methods with `.each`
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - It wasn't bad testing things out or searching around on the web for answers. There is a lot of help out there. Walking away and getting food always helps to sort thoughts.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - Methods for sure
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - Internet or asking people in my BE group
